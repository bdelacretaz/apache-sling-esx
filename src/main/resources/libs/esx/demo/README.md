# Apache Sling ESX Quick Demo

This is a simple application demonstrating some of the ESX script engine possibilities and ideas how to use it.

in future we want to switch to full ES6 syntax but this should give an idea.

The demo application is demonstrating how to use NPM libraries. The project contains a package.json with all dependencies. before deployed you usually need to run npm install to download the nodejs modules and upload them to the repository.

following NPM modules are demonstrated:
- "handlebars": "^4.0.6",
- "highlight.js": "^9.10.0",
- "marked": "^0.3.6",
- "moment": "^2.18.0",
- "underscore": "^1.8.3"
